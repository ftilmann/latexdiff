### ToDo:
###  
###  - add possibility to store configuration options for latexdiff in a file rather than as options
###  - use kdiff3 as a merge tool
###  - make style that allows (forward and backjumping with hyperref)
###  - --flatten option only expands first including command per line if there is more than one
###    --flatten if file not found, don't fail, simply warn and leave input (or equivalent command)
###  - move --show-xxx options so that they are also capable of showing preamble (and commands) after all modificationsbased on source file packages
#
# Version 1.2.2a:
#    - improved pattern matching: now allows nested angular brackets, and is no longer confused by escaped curly braces
#    - improved pattern matching in COARSE mode: occasionally, the closing bracket or some other elements would be matched in an 'unnatural' way due to another sequence being more minimal in the computational sense, sometimes even causing errors due to tokens moving in or out of the scope of math environments. This is now discouraged by adding internal \DIFANCHOR commands (which are removed again in post-processing) (fixes issues reported via email by li_ruomeng . 
#    - verbatim and lstlisting environments are marked-up with line-by-line in a similar style to non-verbatim text (requires the listing package to be installed)
#       (see new configuration variable VERBATIMLINEENV)
#    - --flatten now supports \verbatiminput and \lstlistinput 
#   Bug fixes:
#    - pattern matching of \verb and \lstinline commands had an error which meant they would trigger on commands beginning with \verb.
#
# Version 1.2.1 (22 June 2017)
#    - add "DeclareOldFontCommand" to styles using \bf or \sf old style font commands (fixies issue #92 )
#    - improved markup: process lstinline commands in listings package correctly
#      for styles using colour, \verb and \lstinline arguments are marked up with colour (blue for added, red for deleted)
#    - bug fix: protecting inline math expressions for mbox did not work as intended (see stack exchange question: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/359412/compiling-the-latexdiff-when-adding-a-subscript-before-a-pmatrix-environment-cau)
#    - bug fix: when deleted \item commands are followed immediately by unsafe commands, they were not restored properly
#      (thanks to J. Protze for pull request) (pull request #89)
#    - treat lstlisting and comment as equivalent to verbatim environment
#      make environments that are treated like verbatim environments configurable (config variable VERBATIMENV)
#      treat lstinlne as equivalent to verb command
#      partially addresses issue #38
#    - refactoring: set default configuration variables in a hash, and those that correspond to lists 
#    - feature: option --add-to-config used to amend configuration variables, which are regex pattern lists
#    - bug fix: deleted figures when endfloat package is activated
#    - bug fix: alignat environment now always processed correctly (fix issues #65)
#    - bug fix: avoid processing of commands as potential files in routine init_regex_arr (fix issue #70 )
#    - minimal feature enhancement: treat '@' as allowed character in commands (strictly speaking requires prior \makeatletter statement, but always assuming it to be 
#       @       a letter if it is part of a command name will usually lead to the correct behaviour (see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/346651/latexdiff-and-let)
#    - new feature/bug fix: --flatten option \endinput in included files now respected but only if \endinput stands right at the beginning of the line (issue #77)
#    - bug fix: flatten would incorrectly attempt to process commented out \include commands (from discussion in issue #77 )
#    - introduce an invisible space (\hspace{0pt} after \mbox{..} auxiliary commands (not in math mode), to allow line breaks between added and deleted citations (change should not cause adverse behaviour otherwise)
#
# Version 1.2.0:
#    - highlight new and deleted figures
#    - bug fix in title mark-up. Previously deleted commands in title (such as \title, \author or \date) were marked up erroneously
#    - (minor) bug fixes in new 1.1.1 features: disabled label was commented out twice, additional spaces were introduced before list environment begin and end commands
#    - depracation fix: left brace in RegEx now needs to be escaped
#    - add type PDFCOMMENT based on issue #49 submitted by github user peci1 (Martin Pecka)
#    - make utf8 the default encoding
#
# Version 1.1.1
#    - patch mhchem: allow ce in equations
#    - flatten now also expands \input etc. in the preamble (but not \usepackage!)
#    - Better support for Japanese ( contributed by github user kshramt )
#    - prevent duplicated verbatim hashes (patch contributed by github user therussianjig, issue #36)
#    - disable deleted label commands (fixes issue #31)
#    - introduce post-processing to reinstate most deleted environments and all needed item commands (fixes issue #1)
#
# Version 1.1.0
#    - treat diacritics (\",\', etc) as safe commands
#    - treat \_ and \& correctly as safe commands, even if used without spacing to the next word
#    - Add a BOLD markup type that sets added text in bold face (Contribution by Victor Zabalza via pull request )
#    - add append-mboxsafecmd list option to be able to specify special safe commands which need to be surrounded by mbox to avoid breaking (mostly this is needed with ulem package)
#    - support for siunitx and cleveref packages: protect \SI command in siunitx package and \cref,\Cref{range}{*} in cleveref packages (thanks to Stefan Pinnow for testing)
#    - experimental support for chemformula, mhchem packages: define \ch and \ce in packages as safe (but not \ch,\cee in equation array environments) - these unfortunately will not be marked up (thanks to Stefan Pinnow for testing)
#    - bug fix: packages identified correctly even if \usepackage command options extend over several lines (previously \usepackage command needed to be fully contained in one line)
#    - new subtype ONLYCHANGEDPAGE outputs only changed pages (might not work well for floating material)
#    - new subtype ZLABEL operates similarly to LABEL but uses absolute page numbers (needs zref package)
#    - undocumented option --debug/--nodebug to override default setting for debug mode (Default: 0 for release version, 1: for development version
#
# Version 1.0.4
#    - introduce list UNSAFEMATHCMD, which holds list of commands which cannot be marked up with \DIFadd or \DIFdel commands  (only relevant for WHOLE and COARSE math markup modes)
#    - new subtype LABEL which gives each change a label. This can later be used to only display pages where changes
#      have been made (instructions for that are put as comments into the diff'ed file) inspired by answer on http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/166049/invisible-markers-in-pdfs-using-pdflatex
#    - Configuration variables take into accout some commands from additional packages: 
#      tikzpicture environment now treated as PICTUREENV, and \smallmatrix in ARRENV (amsmath)
#    - --flatten: support for \subfile command (subfiles package)  (in response to http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/167620/latexdiff-with-subfiles )
#    - --flatten: \bibliography commands expand if corresponding bbl file present
#    - angled bracket optional commands now parsed correctly (patch #3570) submitted by Dave Kleinschmidt (thanks)
#    - \RequirePackage now treated as synonym of \usepackage with respect to setting packages
#    - special rules for apacite package (redefine citation commands)
#    - recognise /dev/null as 'file-like' arguments for --preamble and --config options
#    - fix units package incompatibility with ulem for text maths statements $ ..$ (thanks to Stuart Prescott for reporting this)
#    - amsmath environment cases treated correctly (Bug fix #19029) (thanks to Jalar)
#    - {,} in comments no longer confuse latexdiff (Bug fix #19146)
#    - \% in one-letter sub/Superscripts was not converted correctly
#
# Version 1.0.3
#    - fix bug in add_safe_commands that made latexdiff hang on DeclareMathOperator 
#      command in preamble
#    - \(..\) inline math expressions were not parsed correctly, if they contained a linebreak
#    - applied patch contributed by tomflannaghan via Berlios: [ Patch #3431 ] Adds correct handling of \left< and \right>
#    - \$ is treated correctly as a literal dollar sign (thanks to Reed Cartwright and Joshua Miller for reporting this bug 
#      and sketching out the solution)
#    - \^ and \_ are correctly interpreted as accent and underlined space, respectively, not as superscript of subscript
#      (thanks to Wail Yahyaoui for pointing out this bug)
#
# Version 1.0.1 - treat \big,\bigg etc. equivalently to \left and
#              \right - include starred version in MATHENV - apply
#            - flatten recursively and --flatten expansion is now
#              aware of comments (thanks to Tim Connors for patch) 
#            - Change to post-processing for more reliability for
#              deleted math environments
#            - On linux systems, recognise  and remove DOS style newlines 
#            - Provide markup for some special preamble commands (\title,
#              \author,\date, 
#            - configurable by setting context2cmd 
#            - for styles using ulem package, remove \emph and \text.. from list of
#              safe commands in order to allow linebreaks within the
#              highlighted sections.  
#            - for ulem style, now show citations by enclosing them in \mbox commands. 
#              This unfortunately implies linebreaks within citations no longer function, 
#              so this functionality can be turned off (Option --disable-citation-markup). 
#              With --enable-citation-markup, the mbox markup is forced for other styles)
#            - new substyle COLOR.  This is particularly useful for marking up citations
#              and some special post-processing is implemented to retain cite
#              commands in deleted blocks.
#            - four different levels of math-markup
#            - Option --driver for choosing driver for modes employing changebar package
#            - accept \\* as valid command (and other commands of form \.*). Also accept
#              \<nl> (backslashed newline) 
#            - some typo fixes, include commands defined in preamble as safe commands
#              (Sebastian Gouezel) 
#            - include compared filenames as comments as line 2 and 3 of
#              the preamble (can be modified with option --label, and suppressed with 
#              --no-label), option --visible-label to show files in generated pdf or dvi
#              at the beginning of main document
#
# Version 0.5  A number of minor improvements based on feedback
#              Deleted blocks are now shown before added blocks
#              Package specific processing
#
# Version 0.43 unreleased typo in list of styles at the end
#              Add protect to all \cbstart, \cbend commands
#              More robust substitution of deleted math commands
#
# Version 0.42 November 06  Bug fixes only
#
# Version 0.4   March 06 option for fast differencing using UNIX diff command, several minor bug fixes (\par bug, improved highlighting of textcmds)
#
# Version 0.3   August 05 improved parsing of displayed math, --allow-spaces 
#               option, several minor bug fixes
#
# Version 0.25  October 04 Fix bug with deleted equations, add math mode commands to safecmd, add | to allowed interpunctuation signs
# Version 0.2   September 04 extension to utf-8 and variable encodings
# Version 0.1   August 04    First public release

has all changes relative to old.tex marked up or commented. Note that old.tex and new.tex need to
be real files (not pipes or similar) as they are opened twice.

                       replace standard marking and markup commands within floats
                       (e.g., marginal remarks cause an error within floats

                       the token, i.e., /^regex\$/ is implied and that the initial
                       "\\" of the command is not included. The --exclude-safecmd

                       Replace or append to the list of regex matching commands
                       whose last argument is text but which require a particular
                       context to work, e.g. \\caption will only work within a figure
                       or table.  These commands behave like text commands, except when 
                       they occur in a deleted section, when they are disabled, but their
                       argument is shown as deleted text.

--append-context2cmd=append-file
--append-context2cmd="cmd1,cmd2,..."
                       As corresponding commands for context1.  The only difference is that
                       context2 commands are completely disabled in deleted sections, including
                       their arguments.
                       context2 commands are also the only commands in the preamble, whose argument will 
                       be processed in word-by-word mode (which only works, if they occur no more than

                       in an \\mbox{..}. This is sometimes needed to get around incompatibilities

                       For configuration variables containing a regular expression (essentially those ending

                       protected from the shell by quotation). Several patterns can be added at once by using semi-colons
                       to separate them, e.g. --add-to-config "LISTENV=myitemize;myenumerate,COUNTERCMD=endnote"

--packages=pkg1,pkg2,..
                       Tell latexdiff that .tex file is processed with the packages in list 
                       loaded.  This is normally not necessary if the .tex file includes the
                       preamble, as the preamble is automatically scanned for \\usepackage commands.
                       Use of the --packages option disables automatic scanning, so if for any
                       reason package specific parsing needs to be switched off, use --packages=none.
                       The following packages trigger special behaviour:
                       endfloat hyperref amsmath apacite siunitx cleveref glossaries mhchem chemformula/chemmacros
                       [ Default: scan the preamble for \\usepackage commands to determine
                         loaded packages.]

--show-preamble        Print generated or included preamble commands to stdout.

--show-safecmd         Print list of regex matching and excluding safe commands.

--show-textcmd         Print list of regex matching and excluding commands with text argument.

--show-config          Show values of configuration variables

--show-all             Show all of the above

   NB For all --show commands, no old.tex or new.tex file needs to be given, and no 
      differencing takes place.

Other configuration options:

--allow-spaces         Allow spaces between bracketed or braced arguments to commands
                       [Default requires arguments to directly follow each other without 
                                intervening spaces]

--math-markup=level    Determine granularity of markup in displayed math environments:
                      Possible values for level are (both numerical and text labels are acceptable):
                      off or 0: suppress markup for math environments.  Deleted equations will not 
                               appear in diff file. This mode can be used if all the other modes 
                               cause invalid latex code.
                      whole or 1: Differencing on the level of whole equations. Even trivial changes
                               to equations cause the whole equation to be marked changed.  This 
                               mode can be used if processing in coarse or fine mode results in 
                               invalid latex code.
                      coarse or 2: Detect changes within equations marked up with a coarse
                               granularity; changes in equation type (e.g.displaymath to equation) 
                               appear as a change to the complete equation. This mode is recommended
                               for situations where the content and order of some equations are still
                               being changed. [Default]
                      fine or 3: Detect small change in equations and mark up and fine granularity.
                               This mode is most suitable, if only minor changes to equations are
                               expected, e.g. correction of typos. 

--graphics-markup=level   Change highlight style for graphics embedded with \\includegraphics commands
                      Possible values for level:
                      none,off or 0: no highlighting for figures
                      new-only or 1: surround newly added or changed figures with a blue frame [Default]
                      both or 2:     highlight new figures with a blue frame and show deleted figures 
                                at reduced scale, and crossed out with a red diagonal cross. Use configuration
                                variable SCALEDELGRAPHICS to set size of deleted figures.
                      Note that changes to the optional parameters will make the figure appear as changed 
                      to latexdiff, and this figure will thus be highlighted.

--disable-citation-markup 
--disable-auto-mbox    Suppress citation markup and markup of other vulnerable commands in styles 
                       using ulem (UNDERLINE,FONTSTRIKE, CULINECHBAR)
                       (the two options are identical and are simply aliases)

--enable-citation-markup
--enforce-auto-mbox    Protect citation commands and other vulnerable commands in changed sections 
                       with \\mbox command, i.e. use default behaviour for ulem package for other packages
                       (the two options are identical and are simply aliases)

Miscelleneous options

--label=label
-L label               Sets the labels used to describe the old and new files.  The first use
                       of this option sets the label describing the old file and the second
                       use of the option sets the label for the new file.
                       [Default: use the filename and modification dates for the label]

--no-label             Suppress inclusion of old and new file names as comment in output file

--visible-label         Include old and new filenames (or labels set with --label option) as 
                       visible output

--flatten              Replace \\input and \\include commands within body by the content
                       of the files in their argument.  If \\includeonly is present in the
                       preamble, only those files are expanded into the document. However, 
                       no recursion is done, i.e. \\input and \\include commands within 
                       included sections are not expanded.  The included files are assumed to 
                       be located in the same directories as the old and new master files,
                       respectively, making it possible to organise files into old and new directories.
                       --flatten is applied recursively, so inputted files can contain further
                       \\input statements.

--help
-h                     Show this help text.

--ignore-warnings      Suppress warnings about inconsistencies in length between input
                       and parsed strings and missing characters. 

--verbose
-V                     Output various status information to stderr during processing.
                       Default is to work silently.

--version              Show version number.

=head1 NAME

latexdiff - determine and markup differences between two latex files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<latexdiff> [ B<OPTIONS> ] F<old.tex> F<new.tex> > F<diff.tex>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Briefly, I<latexdiff> is a utility program to aid in the management of
revisions of latex documents. It compares two valid latex files, here
called C<old.tex> and C<new.tex>, finds significant differences
between them (i.e., ignoring the number of white spaces and position
of line breaks), and adds special commands to highlight the
differences.  Where visual highlighting is not possible, e.g. for changes
in the formatting, the differences are
nevertheless marked up in the source. Note that old.tex and new.tex need to
be real files (not pipes or similar) as they are opened twice (unless C<--encoding> option is used)

The program treats the preamble differently from the main document.
Differences between the preambles are found using line-based
differencing (similarly to the Unix diff command, but ignoring white
spaces).  A comment, "S<C<%DIF E<gt>>>" is appended to each added line, i.e. a 
line present in C<new.tex> but not in C<old.tex>.  Discarded lines 
 are deactivated by prepending "S<C<%DIF E<lt>>>". Changed blocks are preceded  by
comment lines giving information about line numbers in the original files.  Where there are insignificant
differences, the resulting file C<diff.tex> will be similar to
C<new.tex>.  At the end of the preamble, the definitions for I<latexdiff> markup commands are inserted.
In differencing the main body of the text, I<latexdiff> attempts to
satisfy the following guidelines (in order of priority):

=over 3

=item 1

If both C<old.tex> and C<new.tex> are valid LaTeX, then the resulting
C<diff.tex> should also be valid LateX. (NB If a few plain TeX commands
are used within C<old.tex> or C<new.tex> then C<diff.tex> is not
guaranteed to work but usually will).

=item 2

Significant differences are determined on the level of
individual words. All significant differences, including differences
between comments should be clearly marked in the resulting source code
C<diff.tex>.

=item 3

If a changed passage contains text or text-producing commands, then
running C<diff.tex> through LateX should produce output where added
and discarded passages are highlighted.

=item 4

Where there are insignificant differences, e.g. in the positioning of
line breaks, C<diff.tex> should follow the formatting of C<new.tex>

=back

For differencing the same algorithm as I<diff> is used but words
instead of lines are compared.  An attempt is made to recognize
blocks which are completely changed such that they can be marked up as a unit.
Comments are differenced line by line
but the number of spaces within comments is ignored. Commands including
all their arguments are generally compared as one unit, i.e., no mark-up
is inserted into the arguments of commands.  However, for a selected
number of commands (for example, C<\caption> and all sectioning
commands) the last argument is known to be text. This text is
split into words and differenced just as ordinary text (use options to
show and change the list of text commands, see below). As the
algorithm has no detailed knowledge of LaTeX, it assumes all pairs of
curly braces immediately following a command (i.e. a sequence of
letters beginning with a backslash) are arguments for that command.
As a restriction to condition 1 above it is thus necessary to surround
all arguments with curly braces, and to not insert
extraneous spaces.  For example, write 

  \section{\textem{This is an emphasized section title}}

and not

  \section {\textem{This is an emphasized section title}}

or

  \section\textem{This is an emphasized section title}

even though all varieties are the same to LaTeX (but see
B<--allow-spaces> option which allows the second variety).

For environments whose content does not conform to standard LaTeX or
where graphical markup does not make sense all markup commands can be
removed by setting the PICTUREENV configuration variable, set by
default to C<picture> and C<DIFnomarkup> environments; see B<--config>
option).  The latter environment (C<DIFnomarkup>) can be used to
protect parts of the latex file where the markup results in illegal
markup. You have to surround the offending passage in both the old and
new file by C<\begin{DIFnomarkup}> and C<\end{DIFnomarkup}>. You must
define the environment in the preambles of both old and new
documents. I prefer to define it as a null-environment,

C<\newenvironment{DIFnomarkup}{}{}>

but the choice is yours.  Any markup within the environment will be
removed, and generally everything within the environment will just be
taken from the new file.

It is also possible to difference files which do not have a preamble. 
 In this case, the file is processed in the main document
mode, but the definitions of the markup commands are not inserted.

All markup commands inserted by I<latexdiff> begin with "C<\DIF>".  Added
blocks containing words, commands or comments which are in C<new.tex>
but not in C<old.tex> are marked by C<\DIFaddbegin> and C<\DIFaddend>.
Discarded blocks are marked by C<\DIFdelbegin> and C<\DIFdelend>.
Within added blocks all text is highlighted with C<\DIFadd> like this:
C<\DIFadd{Added text block}>
Selected `safe' commands can be contained in these text blocks as well
(use options to show and change the list of safe commands, see below).
All other commands as well as braces "{" and "}" are never put within
the scope of C<\DIFadd>.  Added comments are marked by prepending
"S<C<%DIF E<gt> >>".

Within deleted blocks text is highlighted with C<\DIFdel>.  Deleted
comments are marked by prepending "S<C<%DIF E<lt> >>".  Non-safe command
and curly braces within deleted blocks are commented out with 
"S<C<%DIFDELCMD E<lt> >>".



=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Preamble

The following options determine the visual markup style by adding the appropriate
command definitions to the preamble. See the end of this section for a description of 
available styles.

=over 4

=item B<--type=markupstyle> or
B<-t markupstyle>

Add code to preamble for selected markup style. This option defines
C<\DIFadd> and C<\DIFdel> commands.
Available styles: 

C<UNDERLINE CTRADITIONAL TRADITIONAL CFONT FONTSTRIKE INVISIBLE 
CHANGEBAR CCHANGEBAR CULINECHBAR CFONTCBHBAR BOLD PDFCOMMENT>

[ Default: C<UNDERLINE> ]

=item B<--subtype=markstyle> or
B<-s markstyle> 

Add code to preamble for selected style for bracketing
commands (e.g. to mark changes in  margin). This option defines
C<\DIFaddbegin>, C<\DIFaddend>, C<\DIFdelbegin> and C<\DIFdelend> commands.
Available styles: C<SAFE MARGIN COLOR DVIPSCOL  ZLABEL ONLYCHANGEDPAGE (LABEL)*>

[ Default: C<SAFE> ]
* Subtype C<LABEL> is deprecated

=item B<--floattype=markstyle> or
B<-f markstyle>

Add code to preamble for selected style which 
replace standard marking and markup commands within floats
(e.g., marginal remarks cause an error within floats
so marginal marking can be disabled thus). This option defines all 
C<\DIF...FL> commands.
Available styles: C<FLOATSAFE TRADITIONALSAFE IDENTICAL>

[ Default: C<FLOATSAFE> ]

=item B<--encoding=enc> or 
B<-e enc>

Specify encoding of old.tex and new.tex. Typical encodings are
C<ascii>, C<utf8>, C<latin1>, C<latin9>.  A list of available encodings can be 
obtained by executing 

C<perl -MEncode -e 'print join ("\n",Encode->encodings( ":all" )) ;' >

If this option is used, then old.tex, new.tex are only opened once.
[Default encoding is utf8 unless the first few lines of the preamble contain
an invocation C<\usepackage[..]{inputenc}> in which case the 
encoding chosen by this command is asssumed. Note that ASCII (standard
latex) is a subset of utf8]

=item B<--preamble=file> or
B<-p file>

Insert file at end of preamble instead of generating
preamble.  The preamble must define the following commands
C<\DIFaddbegin, \DIFaddend, \DIFadd{..},
\DIFdelbegin,\DIFdelend,\DIFdel{..},>
and varieties for use within floats
C<\DIFaddbeginFL, \DIFaddendFL, \DIFaddFL{..},
\DIFdelbeginFL, \DIFdelendFL, \DIFdelFL{..}>
(If this option is set B<-t>, B<-s>, and B<-f> options
are ignored.)

=item B<--packages=pkg1,pkg2,..> 

Tell latexdiff that .tex file is processed with the packages in list
loaded.  This is normally not necessary if the .tex file includes the
preamble, as the preamble is automatically scanned for C<\usepackage> commands.
Use of the B<--packages> option disables automatic scanning, so if for any
reason package specific parsing needs to be switched off, use B<--packages=none>.
The following packages trigger special behaviour:

=over 8

=item C<amsmath> 

Configuration variable MATHARRREPL is set to C<align*> (Default: C<eqnarray*>). (Note that many of the 
amsmath array environments are already recognised by default as such)

=item C<endfloat> 

Ensure that C<\begin{figure}> and C<\end{figure}> always appear by themselves on a line.

=item C<hyperref>

Change name of C<\DIFadd> and C<\DIFdel> commands to C<\DIFaddtex> and C<\DIFdeltex> and 
define new C<\DIFadd> and C<\DIFdel> commands, which provide a wrapper for these commands,
using them for the text but not for the link defining command (where any markup would cause
errors).

=item C<apacite>

Redefine the commands recognised as citation commands.

=item C<siunitx>

Treat C<\SI> as equivalent to citation commands (i.e. protect with C<\mbox> if markup style uses ulem package.

=item C<cleveref>

Treat C<\cref,\Cref>, etc as equivalent to citation commands (i.e. protect with C<\mbox> if markup style uses ulem package.

=item C<glossaries>

Define most of the glossaries commands as safe, protecting them with \mbox'es where needed

=item C<mhchem>

Treat C<\ce> as a safe command, i.e. it will be highlighted (note that C<\cee> will not be highlighted in equations as this leads to processing errors)

=item C<chemformula> or C<chemmacros>

Treat C<\ch> as a safe command outside equations, i.e. it will be highlighted (note that C<\ch> will not be highlighted in equations as this leads to processing errors)


=back

[ Default: scan the preamble for C<\usepackage> commands to determine
  loaded packages. ]



=item B<--show-preamble>

Print generated or included preamble commands to stdout.

=back

=head2 Configuration

=over 4

=item B<--exclude-safecmd=exclude-file> or
B<-A exclude-file> or  B<--exclude-safecmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

=item B<--replace-safecmd=replace-file>

=item B<--append-safecmd=append-file> or 
B<-a append-file> or B<--append-safecmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

Exclude from, replace or append to the list of regular expressions (RegEx)
matching commands which are safe to use within the 
scope of a C<\DIFadd> or C<\DIFdel> command.  The file must contain
one Perl-RegEx per line (Comment lines beginning with # or % are
ignored).  Note that the RegEx needs to match the whole of 
the token, i.e., /^regex$/ is implied and that the initial
"\" of the command is not included. 
The B<--exclude-safecmd> and B<--append-safecmd> options can be combined with the -B<--replace-safecmd> 
option and can be used repeatedly to add cumulatively to the lists.
 B<--exclude-safecmd>
and B<--append-safecmd> can also take a comma separated list as input. If a
comma for one of the regex is required, escape it thus "\,". In most cases it
will be necessary to protect the comma-separated list from the shell by putting
it in quotation marks.

=item B<--exclude-textcmd=exclude-file> or
B<-X exclude-file> or B<--exclude-textcmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

=item B<--replace-textcmd=replace-file>

=item B<--append-textcmd=append-file> or 
B<-x append-file> or B<--append-textcmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

Exclude from, replace or append to the list of regular expressions
matching commands whose last argument is text.  See
entry for B<--exclude-safecmd> directly above for further details.


=item B<--replace-context1cmd=replace-file> 

=item B<--append-context1cmd=append-file> or

=item B<--append-context1cmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

Replace or append to the list of regex matching commands
whose last argument is text but which require a particular
context to work, e.g. C<\caption> will only work within a figure
or table.  These commands behave like text commands, except when 
they occur in a deleted section, when they are disabled, but their
argument is shown as deleted text.

=item B<--replace-context2cmd=replace-file> 

=item B<--append-context2cmd=append-file> or

=item B<--append-context2cmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

As corresponding commands for context1.  The only difference is that
context2 commands are completely disabled in deleted sections, including
their arguments.

context2 commands are also the only commands in the preamble, whose argument will be processed in 
word-by-word mode (which only works, if they occur no more than once in the preamble). The algorithm currently cannot cope with repeated context2 commands in the preamble, as they occur e.g. for the C<\author> argument in some journal styles (not in the standard styles, though
If such a repetition is detected, the whole preamble will be processed in line-by-line mode. In such a case, use C<--replace-context2cmd> option to just select the commands, which should be processed and are not used repeatedly in the preamble. 



=item B<--exclude-mboxsafecmd=exclude-file> or B<--exclude-mboxsafecmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

=item B<--append-mboxsafecmd=append-file> or B<--append-mboxsafecmd="cmd1,cmd2,...">

Define safe commands, which additionally need to be protected by encapsulating
in an C<\mbox{..}>. This is sometimes needed to get around incompatibilities 
between external packages and the ulem package, which is  used for highlighting
in the default style UNDERLINE as well as CULINECHBAR CFONTSTRIKE





=item B<--config var1=val1,var2=val2,...> or B<-c var1=val1,..>

=item B<-c configfile>

Set configuration variables.  The option can be repeated to set different
variables (as an alternative to the comma-separated list).
Available variables (see below for further explanations): 

C<ARRENV> (RegEx)

C<COUNTERCMD> (RegEx)

C<FLOATENV> (RegEx)

C<ITEMCMD> (RegEx)

C<LISTENV>  (RegEx)

C<MATHARRENV> (RegEx)

C<MATHARRREPL> (String)

C<MATHENV> (RegEx)

C<MATHREPL> (String)

C<MINWORDSBLOCK> (Integer)

C<PICTUREENV> (RegEx)

C<SCALEDELGRAPHICS> (Float)

=item B<--add-to-config varenv1=pattern1,varenv2=pattern2,...>

For configuration variables, which are a regular expression (essentially those ending
in ENV, and COUNTERCMD, see list above) this provides an alternative way to modify the configuration 
variables. Instead of setting the complete pattern, with this option it is possible to add an
alternative pattern. C<varenv> must be one of the variables listed above that take a regular
expression as argument, and pattern is any regular expression (which might need to be 
protected from the shell by quotation). Several patterns can be added at once by using semi-colons
to separate them, e.g. C<--add-to-config "LISTENV=myitemize;myenumerate,COUNTERCMD=endnote">

=item B<--show-safecmd>

Print list of RegEx matching and excluding safe commands.

=item B<--show-textcmd>

Print list of RegEx matching and excluding commands with text argument.

=item B<--show-config>

Show values of configuration variables.

=item B<--show-all>

Combine all --show commands.

NB For all --show commands, no C<old.tex> or C<new.tex> file needs to be specified, and no 
differencing takes place.

=back

=head2 Other configuration options:

=over 4

=item B<--allow-spaces>

Allow spaces between bracketed or braced arguments to commands.  Note
that this option might have undesirable side effects (unrelated scope
might get lumpeded with preceding commands) so should only be used if the
default produces erroneous results.  (Default requires arguments to
directly follow each other without intervening spaces).

=item B<--math-markup=level>   

Determine granularity of markup in displayed math environments:               
Possible values for level are (both numerical and text labels are acceptable):

C<off> or C<0>: suppress markup for math environments.  Deleted equations will not 
appear in diff file. This mode can be used if all the other modes 
cause invalid latex code.

C<whole> or C<1>: Differencing on the level of whole equations. Even trivial changes
to equations cause the whole equation to be marked changed.  This 
mode can be used if processing in coarse or fine mode results in 
invalid latex code.

C<coarse> or C<2>: Detect changes within equations marked up with a coarse
granularity; changes in equation type (e.g.displaymath to equation) 
appear as a change to the complete equation. This mode is recommended
for situations where the content and order of some equations are still
being changed. [Default]

C<fine> or C<3>: Detect small change in equations and mark up at fine granularity.
This mode is most suitable, if only minor changes to equations are
expected, e.g. correction of typos. 

=item B<--graphics-markup=level>

 Change highlight style for graphics embedded with C<\includegraphics> commands.

Possible values for level:

C<none>, C<off> or C<0>: no highlighting for figures

C<new-only> or C<1>: surround newly added or changed figures with a blue frame [Default if graphicx package loaded]

C<both> or C<2>:     highlight new figures with a blue frame and show deleted figures at reduced 
scale, and crossed out with a red diagonal cross. Use configuration
variable SCALEDELGRAPHICS to set size of deleted figures.

Note that changes to the optional parameters will make the figure appear as changed 
to latexdiff, and this figure will thus be highlighted

=item B<--disable-citation-markup> or B<--disable-auto-mbox>

Suppress citation markup and markup of other vulnerable commands in styles 
using ulem (UNDERLINE,FONTSTRIKE, CULINECHBAR)
(the two options are identical and are simply aliases)

=item B<--enable-citation-markup> or B<--enforce-auto-mbox>

Protect citation commands and other vulnerable commands in changed sections 
with C<\mbox> command, i.e. use default behaviour for ulem package for other packages
(the two options are identical and are simply aliases)

=back

=head2 Miscellaneous

=over 4

=item B<--verbose> or B<-V>

Output various status information to stderr during processing.
Default is to work silently.

=item B<--driver=type>

Choose driver for changebar package (only relevant for styles using
   changebar: CCHANGEBAR CFONTCHBAR CULINECHBAR CHANGEBAR). Possible
drivers are listed in changebar manual, e.g. pdftex,dvips,dvitops
  [Default: dvips]

=item B<--ignore-warnings>

Suppress warnings about inconsistencies in length between input and
parsed strings and missing characters.  These warning messages are
often related to non-standard latex or latex constructions with a
syntax unknown to C<latexdiff> but the resulting difference argument
is often fully functional anyway, particularly if the non-standard
latex only occurs in parts of the text which have not changed.

=item B<--label=label> or
B<-L label>

Sets the labels used to describe the old and new files.  The first use
of this option sets the label describing the old file and the second
use of the option sets the label for the new file, i.e. set both
labels like this C<-L labelold -L labelnew>.
[Default: use the filename and modification dates for the label]

=item B<--no-label>

Suppress inclusion of old and new file names as comment in output file

=item B<--visible-label>

Include old and new filenames (or labels set with C<--label> option) as 
visible output.

=item B<--flatten>

Replace C<\input> and C<\include> commands within body by the content
of the files in their argument.  If C<\includeonly> is present in the
preamble, only those files are expanded into the document. However, 
no recursion is done, i.e. C<\input> and C<\include> commands within 
included sections are not expanded.  The included files are assumed to 
 be located in the same directories as the old and new master files,
respectively, making it possible to organise files into old and new directories. 
--flatten is applied recursively, so inputted files can contain further
C<\input> statements.

Use of this option might result in prohibitive processing times for
larger documents, and the resulting difference document
no longer reflects the structure of the input documents.

=item B<--help> or
B<-h>

Show help text

=item B<--version>

Show version number

=head2 Predefined styles 

=head2 Major types

The major type determine the markup of plain text and some selected latex commands outside floats by defining the markup commands C<\DIFadd{...}> and C<\DIFdel{...}> .

=over 10

=item C<UNDERLINE>

Added text is wavy-underlined and blue, discarded text is struck out and red
(Requires color and ulem packages).  Overstriking does not work in displayed math equations such that deleted parts of equation are underlined, not struck out (this is a shortcoming inherent to the ulem package).

=item C<CTRADITIONAL>

Added text is blue and set in sans-serif, and a red footnote is created for each discarded 
piece of text. (Requires color package)

=item C<TRADITIONAL>

Like C<CTRADITIONAL> but without the use of color.

=item C<CFONT>

Added text is blue and set in sans-serif, and discarded text is red and very small size.

=item C<FONTSTRIKE>

Added tex is set in sans-serif, discarded text small and struck out

=item C<CCHANGEBAR>

Added text is blue, and discarded text is red.  Additionally, the changed text is marked with a bar in the margin (Requires color and changebar packages).

=item C<CFONTCHBAR>

Like C<CFONT> but with additional changebars (Requires color and changebar packages).

=item C<CULINECHBAR>

Like C<UNDERLINE> but with additional changebars (Requires color, ulem and changebar packages).

=item C<CHANGEBAR>

No mark up of text, but mark margins with changebars (Requires changebar package).

=item C<INVISIBLE>

No visible markup (but generic markup commands will still be inserted.

=item C<BOLD>

Added text is set in bold face, discarded is not shown.

=item C<PDFCOMMENT>

The pdfcomment package is used to underline new text, and mark deletions with a PDF comment. Note that this markup might appear differently or not at all based on the pdf viewer used. The viewer with best support for pdf markup is probably acroread. This style is only recommended if the number of differences is small. 

=back

=head2 Subtypes

The subtype defines the commands that are inserted at the begin and end of added or discarded blocks, irrespectively of whether these blocks contain text or commands (Defined commands: C<\DIFaddbegin, \DIFaddend, \DIFdelbegin, \DIFdelend>) 

=over 10

=item C<SAFE>

No additional markup (Recommended choice)

=item C<MARGIN>

Mark beginning and end of changed blocks with symbols in the margin nearby (using
the standard C<\marginpar> command - note that this sometimes moves somewhat
from the intended position.

=item C<COLOR>

An alternative way of marking added passages in blue, and deleted ones in red.
(It is recommeneded to use instead the main types to effect colored markup,
although in some cases coloring with dvipscol can be more complete, for example 
with citation commands).

=item C<DVIPSCOL>

An alternative way of marking added passages in blue, and deleted ones in red. Note
that C<DVIPSCOL> only works with the dvips converter, e.g. not pdflatex.
(it is recommeneded to use instead the main types to effect colored markup,
although in some cases coloring with dvipscol can be more complete).


=item C<ZLABEL>

can be used to highlight only changed pages, but requires post-processing. It is recommend to not call this option manually but use C<latexdiff-vc> with C<--only-changes> option. Alternatively, use the script given within preamble of diff files made using this style.

=item C<ONLYCHANGEDPAGE> 

also highlights changed pages, without the need for post-processing, but might not work reliably if
there is floating material (figures, tables).

=item C<LABEL> 

is similar to C<ZLABEL>, but does not need the zref package and works less reliably (deprecated).

=back

=head2 Float Types

Some of the markup used in the main text might cause problems when used within 
floats (e.g. figures or tables).  For this reason alternative versions of all
markup commands are used within floats. The float type defines these alternative commands.

=over 10

=item C<FLOATSAFE>

Use identical markup for text as in the main body, but set all commands marking the begin and end of changed blocks to null-commands.  You have to choose this float type if your subtype is C<MARGIN> as C<\marginpar> does not work properly within floats.

=item C<TRADITIONALSAFE>

Mark additions the same way as in the main text.  Deleted environments are marked by angular brackets \[ and \] and the deleted text is set in scriptscript size. This float type should always be used with the C<TRADITIONAL> and  C<CTRADITIONAL> markup types as the \footnote command does not work properly in floating environments.

=item C<IDENTICAL>

Make no difference between the main text and floats.

=back


=head2 Configuration Variables

=over 10

=item C<ARRENV>

If a match to C<ARRENV> is found within an inline math environment within a deleted or added block, then the inlined math 
is surrounded by C<\mbox{>...C<}>.  This is necessary as underlining does not work within inlined array environments.

[ Default: C<ARRENV>=S<C<(?:array|[pbvBV]matrix)> >

=item C<COUNTERCMD>

If a command in a deleted block which is also in the textcmd list matches C<COUNTERCMD> then an
additional command C<\addtocounter{>F<cntcmd>C<}{-1}>, where F<cntcmd> is the matching command, is appended in the diff file such that the numbering in the diff file remains synchronized with the
numbering in the new file.

[ Default: C<COUNTERCMD>=C<(?:footnote|part|section|subsection> ...

C<|subsubsection|paragraph|subparagraph)>  ]

=item C<FLOATENV>

Environments whose name matches the regular expression in C<FLOATENV> are 
considered floats.  Within these environments, the I<latexdiff> markup commands
are replaced by their FL variaties.

[ Default: S<C<(?:figure|table|plate)[\w\d*@]*> >]

=item C<ITEMCMD>

Commands representing new item line with list environments.

[ Default: \C<item> ]

=item C<LISTENV>

Environments whose name matches the regular expression in C<LISTENV> are list environments.

[ Default: S<C<(?:itemize|enumerate|description)> >]

=item C<MATHENV>,C<MATHREPL>

If both \begin and \end for a math environment (environment name matching C<MATHENV> or \[ and \])
are within the same deleted block, they are replaced by a \begin and \end commands for C<MATHREPL>
rather than being commented out.

[ Default: C<MATHENV>=S<C<(?:displaymath|equation)> >, C<MATHREPL>=S<C<displaymath> >]

=item C<MATHARRENV>,C<MATHARRREPL>

as C<MATHENV>,C<MATHREPL> but for equation arrays

[ Default: C<MATHARRENV>=S<C<eqnarray\*?> >, C<MATHREPL>=S<C<eqnarray> >]

=item C<MINWORDSBLOCK>

Minimum number of tokens required to form an independent block. This value is
used in the algorithm to detect changes of complete blocks by merging identical text parts of less than C<MINWORDSBLOCK> to the preceding added and discarded parts.

[ Default: 3 ]

=item C<PICTUREENV>

Within environments whose name matches the regular expression in C<PICTUREENV>
all latexdiff markup is removed (in pathologic cases this might lead to
inconsistent markup but this situation should be rare).

[ Default: S<C<(?:picture|DIFnomarkup)[\w\d*@]*> >]

=item C<SCALEDELGRAPHICS>

If C<--graphics-markup=both> is chosen, C<SCALEDELGRAPHICS> is the factor, by which deleted figures will be scaled (i.e. 0.5 implies they are shown at half linear size).

[ Default: 0.5 ]

=item C<VERBATIMENV>

RegEx describing environments like verbatim, whose contents should be taken verbatim. The content of these environments will not be processed in any way: 
deleted content is commented out, new content is not marked up

[ Default:  S<C<comment> > ]

=item C<VERBATIMLINEENV>

RegEx describing environments like verbatim, whose contents should be taken verbatim. The content of environments described by VERBATIMLINEENV are compared in 
line mode, and changes are marked up using the listings package. The markup style is set based on the chosen mains markup type (Option -t), or on an analysis
of the preamble.
Note that "listings.sty" must be installed. If this file is not found the fallback solution is to 
treat VERBATIMLINEENV environments treated exactly the same way as VERBATIMENV environments.

[ Default:  S<C<(?:verbatim[*]?|lstlisting> > ]

=head1 COMMON PROBLEMS AND FAQ

=over 10

=item Citations result in overfull boxes

There is an incompatibility between the C<ulem> package, which C<latexdiff> uses for underlining and striking out in the UNDERLINE style,
the default style, and the way citations are generated. In order to be able to mark up citations properly, they are enclosed with an C<\mbox> 
command. As mboxes cannot be broken across lines, this procedure frequently results in overfull boxes, possibly obscuring the content as it extends beyond the right margin.  The same occurs for some other packages (e.g., siunitx). If this is a problem, you have two possibilities.

1. Use C<CFONT> type markup (option C<-t CFONT>): If this markup is chosen, then changed citations are no longer marked up
with the wavy line (additions) or struck out (deletions), but are still highlighted in the appropriate color, and deleted text is shown with a different font. Other styles not using the C<ulem> package will also work. 

2. Choose option C<--disable-citation-markup> which turns off the marking up of citations: deleted citations are no longer shown, and
added citations are shown without markup. (This was the default behaviour of latexdiff at versions 0.6 and older)

For custom packages you can define the commands which need to be protected by C<\mbox> with C<--append-mboxsafecmd> and C<--excludemboxsafecmd> options
(submit your lists of command as feature request at github page to set the default behaviour of future versions, see section 6)

=item Changes in complicated mathematical equations result in latex processing errors

Try options C<--math-markup=whole>.   If even that fails, you can turn off mark up for equations with C<--math-markup=off>.

=item How can I just show the pages where changes had been made

Use options -C<-s ZLABEL>  (some postprocessing required) or C<-s ONLYCHANGEDPAGE>. C<latexdiff-vc --ps|--pdf> with C<--only-changes> option takes care of
the post-processing for you (requires zref package to be installed).

=back

=head1 BUGS

=over 10

=item Option allow-spaces not implemented entirely consistently. It breaks
the rules that number and type of white space does not matter, as
different numbers of inter-argument spaces are treated as significant.

=back

Please submit bug reports using the issue tracker of the github repository page I<https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff.git>, 
or send them to I<tilmann -- AT -- gfz-potsdam.de>.  Include the version number of I<latexdiff>
(from comments at the top of the source or use B<--version>).  If you come across latex
files that are error-free and conform to the specifications set out
above, and whose differencing still does not result in error-free
latex, please send me those files, ideally edited to only contain the
offending passage as long as that still reproduces the problem. If your 
file relies on non-standard class files, you must include those.  I will not
look at examples where I have trouble to latex the original files.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<latexrevise>, L<latexdiff-vc>

=head1 PORTABILITY

I<latexdiff> does not make use of external commands and thus should run
on any platform  supporting Perl 5.6 or higher.  If files with encodings 
other than ASCII or UTF-8 are processed, Perl 5.8 or higher is required.

The standard version of I<latexdiff> requires installation of the Perl package
C<Algorithm::Diff> (available from I<www.cpan.org> - 
I<http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15>) but a stand-alone
version, I<latexdiff-so>, which has this package inlined, is available, too.
I<latexdiff-fast> requires the I<diff> command to be present.
