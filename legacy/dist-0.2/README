INTRODUCTION

latexdiff is a Perl script, which compares two latex files and marks
up significant differences between them (i.e. a diff for latex files).
  Various options are available for visual markup using standard latex 
packages such as "color.sty". Changes not directly affecting visible 
text, for example in formatting commands, are still marked in 
the latex source.
 
A rudimentary revision facilility is provided by another Perl script,
latexrevise, which accepts or rejects all changes.  Manual
editing of the difference file can be used to override this default
behaviour and accept or reject selected changes only.  

REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.6 or higher must be installed (5.8 if different encodings are used).
  The standard latexdiff script
requires installation of the Perl package Algorithm::Diff (available 
from www.cpan.org - for current version try
http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15) but an alternative
script, latexdiff-so, which does not require external installation of
this package, is provided, too.
For those with very date perl installations, the stand-along obsolete 
version 0.1 of latexdiff is provided as latexdiff-0.1.

INSTALLATION UNIX/LINUX

The basic installation procedure is almost trivial:

1. Copy latexdiff and latexrevise into a directory which is in the
   search path and make them executable.  If the Algorithm::Diff
   package is not installed, use latexdiff-so instead of latexdiff.

2. Copy latexdiff.1 and latexrevise.1 into the correct man directory

The attached Makefile contains example commands to carry out above 
steps as root for a typical UNIX installation. Type 

  make install

to get it rolling.  After installation you can type

  make test

to test it on a brief example.
