latexdiff \- determine and markup differences between two latex files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBlatexdiff\fR [ \fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR ] \fIold.tex\fR \fInew.tex\fR > \fIdiff.tex\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Briefly, \fIlatexdiff\fR is a utility program to aid in the management of
revisions of latex documents. It compares two valid latex files, here
called \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR, finds significant differences
between them (i.e., ignoring the number of white spaces and position
of line breaks), and adds special commands to highlight the
differences.  Where visual highlighting is not possible, e.g. for changes
in the formatting, the differences are
nevertheless marked up in the source.
.PP
The program treats the preamble differently from the main document.
Differences between the preambles are found using line-based
differencing (similarly to the Unix diff command, but ignoring white
spaces).  A comment, "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ >\*(C'\fR" is appended to each added line, i.e. a 
line present in \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR but not in \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR.  Discarded lines 
 are deactivated by prepending "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ <\*(C'\fR". Changed blocks are preceded  by
comment lines giving information about line numbers in the original files.  Where there are insignificant
differences, the resulting file \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR will be similar to
\&\f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR.  At the end of the preamble, the definitions for \fIlatexdiff\fR markup commands are inserted.
In differencing the main body of the text, \fIlatexdiff\fR attempts to
satisfy the following guidelines (in order of priority):
.IP "1." 3
If both \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR are valid LaTeX, then the resulting
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR should also be valid LateX. (\s-1NB\s0 If a few plain TeX commands
are used within \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR then \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR is not
guaranteed to work but usually will).
.IP "2." 3
Significant differences are determined on the level of
individual words. All significant differences, including differences
between comments should be clearly marked in the resulting source code
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR.
.IP "3." 3
If a changed passage contains text or text-producing commands, then
running \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR through LateX should produce output where added
and discarded passages are highlighted.
.IP "4." 3
Where there are insignificant differences, e.g. in the positioning of
line breaks, \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR should follow the formatting of \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR
.PP
For differencing the same algorithm as \fIdiff\fR is used but words
instead of lines are compared.  An attempt is made to recognize
blocks which are completely changed such that they can be marked up as a unit.
Comments are differenced line by line
but the number of spaces within comments is ignored. Commands including
all their arguments are generally compared as one unit, i.e., no mark-up
is inserted into the arguments of commands.  However, for a selected
number of commands (for example, \f(CW\*(C`\ecaption\*(C'\fR and all sectioning
commands) the last argument is known to be text. This text is
split into words and differenced just as ordinary text (use options to
show and change the list of text commands, see below). As the
algorithm has no detailed knowledge of LaTeX, it assumes all pairs of
curly braces immediately following a command (i.e. a sequence of
letters beginning with a backslash) are arguments for that command.
As a restriction to condition 1 above it is thus necessary to surround
all arguments with curly braces, and to not insert
extraneous spaces.  For example, write
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection{\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}}
.Ve
.PP
and not
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection {\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}}
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}
.Ve
.PP
even though all varieties are the same to LaTeX (but see
\&\fB\-\-allow\-spaces\fR option which allows the second variety).
.PP
For environments whose content does not conform to standard LaTeX or
where graphical markup does not make sense all markup commands can be
removed by setting the \s-1PICTUREENV\s0 configuration variable, set by
default to \f(CW\*(C`picture\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DIFnomarkup\*(C'\fR environments; see \fB\-\-config\fR
option).  The latter environment (\f(CW\*(C`DIFnomarkup\*(C'\fR) can be used to
protect parts of the latex file where the markup results in illegal
markup. You have to surround the offending passage in both the old and
new file by \f(CW\*(C`\ebegin{DIFnomarkup}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eend{DIFnomarkup}\*(C'\fR. You must
define the environment in the preambles of both old and new
documents. I prefer to define it as a null-environment,
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\enewenvironment{DIFnomarkup}{}{}\*(C'\fR
.PP
but the choice is yours.  Any markup within the environment will be
removed, and generally everything within the environment will just be
taken from the new file.
.PP
It is also possible to difference files which do not have a preamble. 
 In this case, the file is processed in the main document
mode, but the definitions of the markup commands are not inserted.
.PP
All markup commands inserted by \fIlatexdiff\fR begin with "\f(CW\*(C`\eDIF\*(C'\fR".  Added
blocks containing words, commands or comments which are in \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR
but not in \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR are marked by \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddend\*(C'\fR.
Discarded blocks are marked by \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelend\*(C'\fR.
Within added blocks all text is highlighted with \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR like this:
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd{Added text block}\*(C'\fR
Selected `safe' commands can be contained in these text blocks as well
(use options to show and change the list of safe commands, see below).
All other commands as well as braces \*(L"{\*(R" and \*(L"}\*(R" are never put within
the scope of \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR.  Added comments are marked by prepending
"\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ >\ \*(C'\fR".
.PP
Within deleted blocks text is highlighted with \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR.  Deleted
comments are marked by prepending "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ <\ \*(C'\fR\*(L".  Non-safe command
and curly braces within deleted blocks are commented out with 
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`%DIFDELCMD\ <\ \*(C'\fR".
.SH "OPTIONS"

The following options determine the visual markup style by adding the appropriate
command definitions to the preamble. See the end of this section for a description of 
available styles.
.IP "\fB\-\-type=markupstyle\fR or \fB\-t markupstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--type=markupstyle or -t markupstyle"

.IP "\fB\-\-subtype=markstyle\fR or \fB\-s markstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--subtype=markstyle or -s markstyle"
Add code to preamble for selected style for bracketing
commands (e.g. to mark changes in  margin). This option defines
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddend\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelend\*(C'\fR commands.
Available styles: \f(CW\*(C`SAFE MARGINAL COLOR DVIPSCOL\*(C'\fR
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-\-floattype=markstyle\fR or \fB\-f markstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--floattype=markstyle or -f markstyle"
Add code to preamble for selected style which 
replace standard marking and markup commands within floats
(e.g., marginal remarks cause an error within floats
so marginal marking can be disabled thus). This option defines all 
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIF...FL\*(C'\fR commands.
Available styles: \f(CW\*(C`FLOATSAFE TRADITIONALSAFE IDENTICAL\*(C'\fR
.Sp
[ Default: \f(CW\*(C`FLOATSAFE\*(C'\fR ]
.IP "\fB\-\-encoding=enc\fR or \fB\-e enc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--encoding=enc or -e enc"
Specify encoding of old.tex and new.tex. Typical encodings are
\&\f(CW\*(C`ascii\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`latin1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`latin9\*(C'\fR.  A list of available encodings can be 
obtained by executing
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-MEncode \-e \*(Aqprint join ("\en",Encode\-\*(C'\fRencodings( \*(L":all\*(R" )) ;' >
.Sp
[Default encoding is utf8 unless the first few lines of the preamble contain
an invocation \f(CW\*(C`\eusepackage[..]{inputenc}\*(C'\fR in which case the 
encoding chosen by this command is asssumed. Note that \s-1ASCII\s0 (standard
latex) is a subset of utf8]
.IP "\fB\-\-preamble=file\fR or \fB\-p file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--preamble=file or -p file"
Insert file at end of preamble instead of generating
preamble.  The preamble must define the following commands
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin, \eDIFaddend, \eDIFadd{..},
\&\eDIFdelbegin,\eDIFdelend,\eDIFdel{..},\*(C'\fR
and varieties for use within floats
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbeginFL, \eDIFaddendFL, \eDIFaddFL{..},
\&\eDIFdelbeginFL, \eDIFdelendFL, \eDIFdelFL{..}\*(C'\fR
(If this option is set \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-s\fR, and \fB\-f\fR options
are ignored.)
.IP "\fB\-\-packages=pkg1,pkg2,..\fR" 4
.IX Item "--packages=pkg1,pkg2,.."
Tell latexdiff that .tex file is processed with the packages in list
loaded.  This is normally not necessary if the .tex file includes the
preamble, as the preamble is automatically scanned for \f(CW\*(C`\eusepackage\*(C'\fR commands.
Use of the \fB\-\-packages\fR option disables automatic scanning, so if for any
reason package specific parsing needs to be switched off, use \fB\-\-packages=none\fR.
The following packages trigger special behaviour:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """amsmath""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWamsmath\fR" 8
.IX Item "amsmath"
Configuration variable amsmath is set to \f(CW\*(C`align*\*(C'\fR (Default: \f(CW\*(C`eqnarray*\*(C'\fR)
.ie n .IP """endfloat""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWendfloat\fR" 8
.IX Item "endfloat"
Ensure that \f(CW\*(C`\ebegin{figure}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eend{figure}\*(C'\fR always appear by themselves on a line.
.ie n .IP """hyperref""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWhyperref\fR" 8
.IX Item "hyperref"
Change name of \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR commands to \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddtex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdeltex\*(C'\fR and 
define new \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR commands, which provide a wrapper for these commands,
using them for the text but not for the link defining command (where any markup would cause
errors).

matching commands which are safe to use within the 
scope of a \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR command.  The file must contain
one Perl-RegEx per line (Comment lines beginning with # or % are
ignored).  Note that the RegEx needs to match the whole of 
the token, i.e., /^regex$/ is implied and that the initial
\&\*(L"\e\*(R" of the command is not included. 
The \fB\-\-exclude\-safecmd\fR and \fB\-\-append\-safecmd\fR options can be combined with the \-\fB\-\-replace\-safecmd\fR 
option and can be used repeatedly to add cumulatively to the lists.
 \fB\-\-exclude\-safecmd\fR
and \fB\-\-append\-safecmd\fR can also take a comma separated list as input. If a
comma for one of the regex is required, escape it thus \*(L"\e,\*(R". In most cases it
will be necessary to protect the comma-separated list from the shell by putting
it in quotation marks.

Possible values for level are (both numerical and text labels are acceptable):
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR or \f(CW0\fR: suppress markup for math environments.  Deleted equations will not 
appear in diff file. This mode can be used if all the other modes 
cause invalid latex code.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`whole\*(C'\fR or \f(CW1\fR: Differencing on the level of whole equations. Even trivial changes
to equations cause the whole equation to be marked changed.  This 
mode can be used if processing in coarse or fine mode results in 
invalid latex code.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`coarse\*(C'\fR or \f(CW2\fR: Detect changes within equations marked up with a coarse
granularity; changes in equation type (e.g.displaymath to equation) 
appear as a change to the complete equation. This mode is recommended
for situations where the content and order of some equations are still
being changed. [Default]
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`fine\*(C'\fR or \f(CW3\fR: Detect small change in equations and mark up at fine granularity.

.Sp
\&\fB\-\-ignore\-warnings\fR
.Sp
Suppress warnings about inconsistencies in length between input and
parsed strings and missing characters.  These warning messages are
often related to non-standard latex or latex constructions with a
syntax unknown to \f(CW\*(C`latexdiff\*(C'\fR but the resulting difference argument
is often fully functional anyway, particularly if the non-standard
latex only occurs in parts of the text which have not changed.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-label=label\fR or
\&\fB\-L label\fR
.Sp
Sets the labels used to describe the old and new files.  The first use
of this option sets the label describing the old file and the second
use of the option sets the label for the new file, i.e. set both
labels like this \f(CW\*(C`\-L labelold \-L labelnew\*(C'\fR.
[Default: use the filename and modification dates for the label]
.Sp

Suppress inclusion of old and new file names as comment in output file
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-visble\-label\fR
.Sp
Include old and new filenames (or labels set with \-\-label option) as 
visible output.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-flatten\fR
.Sp
Replace \f(CW\*(C`\einput\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\einclude\*(C'\fR commands within body by the content
of the files in their argument.  If \f(CW\*(C`\eincludeonly\*(C'\fR is present in the
preamble, only those files are expanded into the document. However, 
no recursion is done, i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\einput\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\einclude\*(C'\fR commands within 
included sections are not expanded.  The included files are assumed to 
 be located in the same directories as the old and new master files,
respectively, making it possible to organise files into old and new directories. 
\&\-\-flatten is applied recursively, so inputted files can contain further
\&\f(CW\*(C`\einput\*(C'\fR statements.
.Sp
Use of this option might result in prohibitive processing times for
larger documents, and the resulting difference document
no longer reflects the structure of the input documents.

There is an incompatibility between the \f(CW\*(C`ulem\*(C'\fR package, which \f(CW\*(C`latexdiff\*(C'\fR uses for underlining and striking out in the \s-1UNDERLINE\s0 style,
the default style. In order to be able to mark up citations properly, they are placed with an \f(CW\*(C`\embox\*(C'\fR command in post-processing. As mboxes
cannot be broken across lines, this procedure frequently results in overfull boxes, possibly obscuring the content as it extends beyond the right margin. If this is a problem, you have two possibilities:
.Sp
1. Use \f(CW\*(C`COLOR\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`DVIPSCOL\*(C'\fR subtype markup (option \f(CW\*(C`\-s COLOR\*(C'\fR): If this markup is chosen, then changed citations are no longer marked up
with the wavy line (additions) or struck out (deletions), but are still highlighted in the appropriate color.
.Sp
2. Choose option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-citation\-markup\*(C'\fR which turns off the marking up of citations: deleted citations are no longer shown, and
added ctations are shown without markup. (This was the default behaviour of latexdiff at versions 0.6 and older)
